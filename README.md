# Telegram bot Hamsti
Universal template for the quick implementation of telegram bots.

## About TBotHamsti
TBotHamsti is universal template for faster implementation of telegram bots, including command levels and user management. 

This template has a command level system to help you categorize multiple commands into their own levels. There is also a extended user management system, with some settings and full control over them.
>For example, how it works: the application **TBotHamsti** is located on the local machine and uses some commands to control the PC or perform other actions if the user has a enough level to launch them.

### Screenshots
Take a look at some [screenshots](https://github.com/Hamsti/TBotHamsti/wiki/Screenshots) to understand what the user interface is to control the bot.

## History of creating
When I started working on this project, it was just for fun, but after I started using more and more technologies, this project helped me learn something new every day (and for personal use). 
>Looking at this project, you can see each stage of my training by looking at the commits, and of course also see the current technical level.
